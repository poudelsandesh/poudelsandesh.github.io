## About
A PhD student and Graduate Research Assistant at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, specializing in cutting-edge research at the intersection of engineering and agriculture. I hold a Master’s degree from the College of Engineering, University of Georgia (UGA), where I cultivated a strong foundation in agricultural engineering and technological innovation.

My research interest includes Robotics, Drone Image Analysis, Computer Vision, Artificial Intelligence, Remote Sensing, Machine Learning, Precision Agriculture, Data Science, Computational Engineering, Agricultural Mechanization and Extension. I am passionate about leveraging advanced technologies to address challenges in sustainable agriculture, environmental monitoring, and engineering systems design.

In addition to my research, I authored the book "Agricultural Extension Education", a resource designed to enhance the knowledge and skills of Bachelor’s-level agriculture students. Feel free to connect with me to discuss research collaborations, innovative projects, or opportunities in precision agriculture and agricultural engineering.
